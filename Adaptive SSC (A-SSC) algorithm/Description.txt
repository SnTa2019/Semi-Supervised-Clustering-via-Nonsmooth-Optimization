Adaptive SSC (A-SSC) is an algorithm for solving semi-supervised clustering (SSC) problems with pairwise, Must-Link (ML) and Cannot-Link (CL), constraints. 
The SSC problem is first formulated as a nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem. 
The A-SSC algorithm is introduced to solve this problem. 
The algorithm is based on a nonsmooth optimization method and an incremental approach. 
The use of the incremental approach allows us to deal with the nonconvexity of the SSC problem by generating initial points being good approximations to the solution. 
The nonsmooth optimization method (discrete gradient method) is applied to solve the underlying SSC problems. 
The A-SSC algorithm has a high performance in identifying compact and well-separated clusters while satisfying most constraints.
