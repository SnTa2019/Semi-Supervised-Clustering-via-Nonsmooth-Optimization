Adaptive SSC (A-SSC) is an algorithm for solving semi-supervised clustering (SSC) problems with pairwise, Must-Link (ML) and Cannot-Link (CL), constraints. 
The SSC problem is first formulated as a nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem. 
The A-SSC algorithm is introduced to solve this problem. 
The algorithm is based on a nonsmooth optimization method and an incremental approach. 
The use of the incremental approach allows us to deal with the nonconvexity of the SSC problem by generating initial points being good approximations to the solution. 
The nonsmooth optimization method (discrete gradient method) is applied to solve the underlying SSC problems. 
The A-SSC algorithm has a high performance in identifying compact and well-separated clusters while satisfying most constraints.
	

	
Fortran code of the A-SSC algorithm is provided.
ML and CL constraints are also provided: 
To generate ML and CL pairs for each data set, we randomly select two instances from the data set and check their class labels. 
If the labels are the same, then we consider these instances as a ML pair. Otherwise, they are chosen as a CL pair. 
The procedure is repeated mpairs times for each data set (with the number of observation m), where mpairs is defined as:
mpairs =
--- 0.2m,                    m ≤ 1000,
--- max{200,0.1m},   1000  < m ≤ 4000,
--- max{400,0.05m},  4000  < m ≤ 12000,
--- max{600,0.02m},  12000 < m ≤ 20000.
